## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  numpy>=1.19.2
  tensorflow>=2.5.0
  scikit-learn>=0.24.2
  scikit-fuzzy>=0.4.2
  matplotlib>=3.3.4
  ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/soft-computing.git
   cd soft-computing
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Fuzzy Logic System
```python
from algorithms.fuzzy_logic import FuzzyController

# Create a temperature control system
controller = FuzzyController()
controller.add_variable("temperature", range=[0, 100])
controller.add_rule("IF temperature IS high THEN cooling IS high")
result = controller.evaluate({"temperature": 75})
```

### Neural Network
```python
from algorithms.neural_nets import SimpleNN

# Create and train a basic neural network
model = SimpleNN(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=2)
model.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
